# introduction
0x02-i18n is a technical notation used within the context of internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n) in software development. The term "i18n" itself is shorthand for "internationalization," where the "18" represents the number of letters between the first "i" and the last "n." Internationalization involves designing and coding software applications in such a way that they can be easily adapted for various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes to the source code. The prefix "0x02" indicates that this is likely the second topic or section in a series or documentation related to internationalization, following a hexadecimal numbering convention often used in technical fields. This section might cover specific guidelines, techniques, or tools related to implementing internationalization in software projects.
