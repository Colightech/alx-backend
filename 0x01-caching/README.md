# introduction
Caching is a technique used in computing to store copies of data in a temporary storage location, or cache, so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The primary goal of caching is to improve the efficiency and speed of data retrieval, reducing the need to repeatedly access slower storage mediums, such as hard drives or remote servers. In the context of the 0x01-caching project, this typically involves implementing caching mechanisms in software to optimize performance in various applications, such as web development, database management, and system operations. By effectively managing cached data, systems can handle more requests with lower latency, leading to enhanced overall performance and user experience.
